### Background

As a company we are looking to migrate all of their accounts and sales opportunities to our Salesforce Platform. ExtremeSupermanCaves have provided us with a CSV that includes all of their accounts. However, due to compliance issues they cannot provide us a file of the sales opportunities associated with those accounts. They have exposed a web service for us to consume that allows us to get the associated opportunities based on account name. Their opportunities have a quote attribute that our opportunities do not have; we will need to account for that.Their opportunities have a price attribute that our opportunities do not have. In addition, we want to give the Opportunities a discount on their existing quote of 20%.
